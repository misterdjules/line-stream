[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/misterdjules/line-stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/misterdjules/line-stream)

line-stream is a simple [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) transform stream that allows
to split input data into lines. It's been written for educational purposes, do not
rely on it for writing code that needs to run in production.

Use [node-byline](https://github.com/jahewson/node-byline) instead if you're looking for a robust solution.
